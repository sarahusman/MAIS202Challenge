I used Jupyter Notebook to write my code and plot my results. The file has extension .ipynb (iPython Notebook)

Rendered blob should show up fine on github, however as mentioned on this page: 

	https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-jupyter-notebook-files-on-github/

The source blob is static html.

You can view my code on an online notebook viewer:

By adding my .ipynb file url:
